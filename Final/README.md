# The Final Workshop Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for our series of workshops. The goal is to guide participants through building a chat application, introducing them to essential software engineering concepts that are often not covered in university curricula.

---

### Objectives
Throughout these workshops, participants will:
- Gain hands-on experience with key tools and practices in software development.
- Learn to create a functional and portfolio-worthy chat application.
- Explore industry-relevant topics in a structured and engaging way.

### Topics Covered
Participants will be introduced to the following concepts and tools:
- **IDEs and Debugging:** Understanding how to efficiently develop and troubleshoot code.
- **Git and GitHub:** Learning version control and collaboration techniques.
- **Web Applications with Flask:** Building and deploying lightweight web applications.
- **APIs and LangChain:** Exploring APIs like Google Gemini and OpenAI for building agentic systems.

### Workshop Goals
Our aim is to make the workshops:
1. **Engaging:** Participants will actively build a project and solve real-world problems.
2. **Practical:** The final product serves as a valuable addition to their portfolio.
